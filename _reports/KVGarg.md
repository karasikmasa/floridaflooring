bio: >
  I am a final year student (expected graduation month - June 2020) studying
  Computer Science and Engineering at Chandigarh College of Engineering and
  Technology, Chandigarh. I participated in GSoC'19 with
  [coala](https://coala.io) open-source organization.

  My project aimed to increase the usability and easiness for all the
  open-source enthusiasts by enhancing and improving the coala
  [Community website](https://community.coala.io/) as well as coala [Projects
  website](https://projects.coala.io/) for newcomers, developers as well as for
  the other communities. The major focus of this project was to enhance the
  website's architecture, with the addition of new API endpoints in coala
  [Webservices](https://webservices.coala.io/). *CRON Jobs* have been
  defined in coala Webservices which will make sure that the data related to
  the organization is up-to-date, which will be used in coala websites.

### Enhance Websites Architecture


#### Work Done

1. Back-end Enhancements (in coala Webservices):
   1. Fix the existing issues with the runnable cron jobs
   2. Added cron jobs for fetching
      1. users feedback,
      2. open-source google form available to all developers,
      3. calendar events,
      4. requests of contributors who participated in GSoC with the
       organization and wanted to add their project details to the database,
       and
      5. requests of developers who wanted to participate as a mentor in the
       upcoming Google Summer of Code,

      from coala Community website and store them.
   3. Added a cron job for -
      1. fetching contributors geolocation;
      2. validating the access token, used for logging-in onto the coala
       Community website;
      3. fetching the contributor's activities data like the issue, merge
       requests, commits related activities;
      4. users who want to join the organization;
      5. processing the contributor's request who want to get assigned on an
       issue; and
      6. processing the newcomer's request who wanted to get promoted to the
       developer role;
   4. Update the organization teams information weekly
   5. Migrated following apps from coala Community repository -
      1. inactive issues scrapper,
      2. filtering the issues to get all unassigned issues activity,
      3. meta-review system,
      4. gamification system, and
      5. activity scrapper

      as there should only one database which stores all the information
      related to the organization.
   6. Added continuous deployment to the repository
   7. Added an endpoint to fetch a single GitHub/GitLab issue
   8. Updated the homepage of coala Webservices, to add information about new
    enhancements added to the webservices.

2. Enhancements made in coala Community Website:
   1. Created a project-specific logo, which can be re-used by any open-source
   community
   2. Re-designed the homepage, by adding a new UI/UX design to it.
   3. Merged up the build information and build logs web-pages, to one web-page
   with a nice UI/UX design added to that web-page.
   4. Re-designed the Google Code-In students web-page, by adding a new UI/UX
    design to it.
   5. Re-designed the contributor's web-page, by adding a new UI/UX design to
    it and with a search bar to search for a contributor among thousands of
    contributors.
   6. Re-designed the meta-review web-page, by adding a new UI/UX design to
    it and with a search-bar to search for a single contributor.
   7. Re-designed the gamification leaderboard web-page, by adding a new UI/UX
    design to it and with a search bar as well as some filters.
   8. Added Netlify OAuth for getting access to the community forms like
    promotion request form, getting assigned to an issue, etc.
   9. Added following netlify forms to the website -
      1. organization join form,
      2. calendar event uploader form,
      3. uploading information about open source organizations forms like any
       conference, workshop, etc.
      4. participate as a mentor in the upcoming Google Summer of Code,
      5. add your GSoC project related details
      6. "want to get assigned on an issue?" form
      7. promotion to developer role form, and
      8. a feedback form
   10. Added a pop-up, to display all the contributor activities (or say all
    the contributions details) in the form of charts.
   11. Remove the usage of implemented OpenHub models in the repository and
    use the OpenHub-Django pypi package instead.
   12. Added a web-page for displaying the organization teams to the logged-in
   users.
   13. Re-designed the web-page that lists-out all the inactive issues across
    the organization, by adding a new UI/UX design to it and showing the
    issue related details.
   14. Re-designed the web-page that lists-out all the unassigned issues
    activity across the organization, by adding a new UI/UX design to it and
    showing the issue related details.
   15. Added a web-page for displaying the organization mentors for the
    upcoming summer/winter programs like GSoC, GCI, etc.
   16. Updated the repository README.md to mention about the new enhancements
    made and how to use them?

3. Enhancements 'n' Improvements made in coala Projects Website:
   1. Fetch the GSoC mentors from coala Webservices too.
   2. Added a tab for displaying all the Open-Source forms by fetching it
    from coala Webservices.
   3. Added filters for searching GSoC projects.
   4. Added a tab for displaying all the calendar events by fetching it
    from coala Webservices.
   5. Fetch the related issues state from coala Webservices for a chosen
    project and change the CSS class based on that state.
   6. Re-named the projects report web-page to a web-page which displays all
    the past years GSoC students. The students who've participated with coala
    in GSoC in previous years. This new web-page now has a respective tab in
    navbar instead of an inline-link.
   7. Changed the tabs display to a navbar i.e. added a navbar to the website
    for navigating around the web-pages.

Apart from this, I've contributed to the [openhub-django](https://github.com/sks444/openhub-django/)
repository, so that it can get ready to be used in the coala Community
repository, to get the details about the organization from the OpenHub. And,
added necessary documentation(or say information) for contributors in the
[Newcomers' Guide](https://coala.io/newcomer) mentioning about the forms
available on the coala Community website.

#### Challenges

Most things went smoothly. The biggest challenge for me was to design the
web-pages mockup designs and the logo for the coala community website because
the community repository is a re-usable repository i.e. any organization can
fork this repo and use it without making any major changes in the code. So, the
logo must symbolize all the open-source communities. And, another challenge was
to decide the validation checks which will be implemented to check whether the
form entry (the form submitted by a user on coala Community website) is valid
or not. But I am grateful to my helpful mentors for supporting me and making
the tasks easier.

#### Work to be done

Just left with to make usage of coala Webservices with coala Community website.
Currently, the data is being fetched from a repository which contains the
static data about the organization. And, to use coala Webservices with
Community website, all the created merge requests in the repositories should
get merged so that we can fetch the realtime-data of the organization and
display it on the website.
