bio: >
 I'm a graduating student from the Master's program in Computer Engineering at Queen's University. I will be starting my PhD in September, 2019. I started contributing code to `coala` several years ago and have made contributions such as bug fixes, writing tests and feature implementation. I have also served as a google code-in mentor for coala. My most recent contribution includes participating in the Google Summer of Code with coala under the project of Cohesive Editor Support.

### Cohesive Editor Support


#### Work Done

[coala spyder](https://gitlab.com/coala/editors/coala-spyder) is now a functional coala plugin and can be launched from the spyder editor. The repository has unittests and continuous integration set up with TravisCI.
It can also be tested as a stand-alone widget.

<br>

[coala sublime](https://gitlab.com/coala/editors/coala-sublime) is now a functional plugin for `Sublime Text 3` with all of the bells and whistles of SublimeLinter.
[coala vim](https://gitlab.com/coala/editors/coala-vim) is now a functional plugin for `vim` and `neovim` powered by the functionality of `syntastic`.

<br>

The three above projects have been added to the main `coala` organisation on Gitlab which involved rewriting the commit history to remove the fixups,
and meeting the requirements of a maintainable organisational project.


#### Challenges

The main challenge was time management and allocation of sufficient time towards the Cohesive Editor Support project as I was also working on a university project at the time. The quick replies of my mentor, [John](https://github.com/jayvdb) and setting me on the right path helped me get more out of myself than I would've been able to without him.

<br>

Another challenge was diving into undocumented territory when working with integrating the `spyder-coala` widget with the `spyder` IDE.

#### Work to be done

For the first plugin - `coala spyder`, there are two main bugs that need to be fixed:

1) [Obtaining the current file for run_coala](https://gitlab.com/coala/editors/coala-spyder/issues/1)

2) [Widget crashing when unpacking from button](https://gitlab.com/coala/editors/coala-spyder/issues/2)

Also, unittests currently do not have full coverage.

<br>

For the second plugin - `coala sublime`, there is one main bug that needs to be fixed:

[Fix pileup of linter flags](https://gitlab.com/coala/editors/coala-sublime/issues/1)

Also, unittests and CI has not been set up for this repository.

<br>

For the third plugin - `coala vim`, unittests and CI needs to be set up.

<br>

For `AtomRequirement` in the `dependency_management` repo, all functions are not yet added to check for `apm` installed packages.
