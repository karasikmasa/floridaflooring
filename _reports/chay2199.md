bio: >
 I'm a third year student (expected graduation date: May 2021) of Computer Science at Birla Institute of Technology, Mesra. I participated in GSoC and worked with [coala](https://coala.io) on building a Result Reporter Tool, which loads data from coala-json output and converts it to test result report formats like JUnit, TAP and Checkstyle. [coala-json](https://pypi.org/project/coala-json/) is a python package now, and thus it can be extended to any other project. To generate test reports using a particular json output you simply have to create a custom loader file.

### Result Reporter Tool


#### Work Done

[coala-json](https://gitlab.com/coala/coala-json) has many test report formats as outputs.

[Documentation](https://coala-json.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) at ReadTheDocs

[Website](https://coala-json.netlify.com) hosted at netlify.

coala-json can be used to load data from coala-json output and produce various
test result report formats that can be used to visualise test report artifacts
at a glance across various CI/CD tools.
coala-json is now a python package and can be extended to any project with a
json output simply by changing the loader file. I also contribute to
coala/mobans so that the whole coala community can take advantage of the work
done in coala-json. I do some other contributions to the community, including
doing reviews, and fixing several issues around coala & coala-bears repo.

#### Challenges

Most things went smoothly. I used to get uncomfortable while deciding on the structure
of coala-json as I was building the whole project almost from scratch. Some of my OOPs
concepts were not upto the task but with the help of my mentor I learned many new concepts
along the way. My mentor used to review my code almost on the same day whenever I requested
him and that really helped me. coala community always expects a high quality of code and
I am happy that I was able to succeed.

#### Work to be done

As a project coala-json has a lot of scope to be extended and improved. Currently the
whole coala community is not using coala-json. All CIs should include coala-json
section in their templates. More test reports can be generated in the future. The mapping
of coala-json can be improved to provide more information to the test reports. Moreover
currently the loader file needs to be changed to if some other project needs to use
coala-json for their json output, this process can be made more simpler or should vanish
in the future.
