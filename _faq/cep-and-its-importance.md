question: "What is a cEP? Why is it so important to do a pre-GSoC analysis
and design a proposal as early as possible?"
---
A **cEP (coala Enhancement Proposal)** is proposed to the **coala** community
to discuss the new *major features* that the contributor intends to implement
during GSoC. The proposal is designed before the implementation of *major
features* because the implementation usually happens from a technical
perspective which may lead to a poorly designed content, both developer-wise
and user-wise. So, to avoid this, a cEP should be designed at an earlier stage
as this also saves a lot of coding work and makes sure that the major features
are properly documented.

Experience tells us that the best GSoC students are the ones who heavily
contribute to the project ideas' website, create projects from the issues, and
expand on the existing ***.md*** files.

So, if you are planning to participate in GSoC with coala, you should start by
writing a detailed project idea in our [projects](https://github.com/coala/projects)
repository. Also, enough research about the project of interest must be done,
so that you're able to express your ideas, timeline, etc clearly in your GSoC
proposal as this will increase your chances of success.

For more information and to learn more about writing a cEP, refer to the
[cEP repository](https://github.com/coala/cEPs).
