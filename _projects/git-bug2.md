[git-bug](https://github.com/MichaelMure/git-bug) is a distributed
bug-tracker embedded in git. It allows contributor to a project to browse,
edit and collaborate on issues, including offline, with no more than the
normal git remote repository that you are already using for the source
code of your project.

git-bug provide a set of command line tools, an interactive terminal UI and a
rich web UI. git-bug also provide bridges with external bugtracker like Github,
Gitlab or Jira.

Multiple projects are possible:
- implementing support for pull-requests
- improving various components (bridges, webui, termui ...)
