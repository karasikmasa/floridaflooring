[Gitmate](https://gitlab.com/gitmate) is one of the most
integrated git solution at coala. Unfortunately, the project was
then left unmaintained and hence needs a revamp. Gitmate helps
coala in handling some of the crucial workflows responsible for
a smooth development experience for the newcomers in open-source
community.

As a part of the project we will be integrating gitmate with coala
and will be maintaing the project here. IGitt is the package powering
the Git workflow for Gitmate. This project will require several
improvements to IGitt as well to ensure Gitmate works well with the
latest API versions for Github, Gitlab and Jira.

Due to recent changes in GSoC with the program being only for 10 weeks
the coding phases below are adjusted accordingly.

#### Milestones

##### COMMUNITY BONDING

* Student should have a clear plan and conceptual work must be finished.
* The applicant should know how to work with the community.

##### CODING PHASE 1

* Changes to the IGitt must be finished including writing tests and
documentation.

##### CODING PHASE 2

* Gitmate should have a proper integration with the latest API versions of
Github, Gitlab and Jira.
* Refactoring of the existing CI/CD setup for Gitmate.
